# ML-Supervised--mini-project-classification-
Comprehensive project for Supervised Machine learning
The objective of this Project is to evaluate the understanding and ability to apply supervised learning techniques to a real-world dataset.
Different steps followed for this is given below
Loading and Preprocessing -Check for missing values,Feature scaling
Classification Algorithm Implementation-implemented the following algorithms
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree Classifier
3. Random Forest Classifier
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
5. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
Compared the models and chose the best and worst ones.
